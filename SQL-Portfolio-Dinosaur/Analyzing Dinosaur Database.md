# Paleontological Data
Paleontological data is extremely important for the evolutionary history of the Earth, allowing scientists the ability to peer into the past and trace the journey of various species. By examining changes created by history through the use of fossils, paleontologists can analyze and comprehend how life has slowly yet intensely adapted and diversify through the course of millions of years.

In this notebook, we are going to trim, clean, and analyze dinosaur data obtained from [Kaggle.com ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kjanjua/jurassic-park-the-exhaustive-dinosaur-dataset) while simultaneously creating a simulated paleontological research project. After a recent expedition, several of our paleontologists came through with fantastic finds! Returning home from their fieldwork and expedition, they have gathered an abundance of valuable prehistoric data from around the globe. Along with the data gathered, our leadership of stakeholders, consisting of senior palaeontologists, archaeologists, and lab analysts will guide and challenge us to find life's most curious prehistoric mysteries! From trying to formulate the migration patterns to figuring out evolutionary traits influenced by diet, we will uncover the truth about so many formerly ambiguous dinosaurs.
